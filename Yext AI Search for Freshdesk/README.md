## Yext AI Search for Freshdesk

With Yext AI Search, support leaders can empower their agents to drive faster case resolution that increases customer loyalty and satisfaction. By automatically populating the agent's search experience with the ticket subject line, Yext AI Search uses natural language understanding to interpret customers' intent and deliver contextually relevant direct answers for agents to efficiently resolve cases. Get started here and supercharge your search in Freshdesk.

* Serves direct answers to agents instead of long-form articles or blue links, powered by Yext's multiple search algorithms, including Extractive Question Answering (QA), which pulls exact answers from within a document or article and surfaces it as a rich snippet

* Displays content in a single unified search experience through a federated architecture, helping agents cut through the noise and reducing information silos by centralizing all support data for easy retrieval

* Embeds both search queries and FAQs in vector space and uses a Semantic Text Search algorithm to determine the most relevant FAQsâ€”no synonyms required!

* Tracks the savings associated with case deflection and identifies content gaps that need to be addressed. Automatically groups similar searches, even if they contain different query phrasings, to improve search at scale

* Uses machine learning to automatically rerank results based on what has previously resolved cases before
